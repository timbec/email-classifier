This is a basic email classifier. It uses a pretrained model from HuggingFace to classify emails. It is built using FastAPI.

The problem: I, probably like most people, have tens of thousands of unread emails clogging up my inbox. I could manually delete all these emails, but since most are either years old or irrelevant, it's a waste of time. I want to build a tool that will automatically delete emails that I don't care about and so free up my inbox.
